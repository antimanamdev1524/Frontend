HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. technically, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language.
 HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding
 HTML, 4.01, XHTML, 1.0 and XHTML, 1.1 HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the world wide web.
 
 HTML5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML, where we needed lower case tag names, quoting our attributes an attribute had to have a value and to close all empty elements.
 
 But HTML5 is coming with lots of
 flexibility: 
 Upper tag names: <b> <B>
 Quotes are optional for attributes.
 style="color:red"   
 type "text/css"

 Attribute values are optional.
 type="text/css" === if not added that optional
 closing empty elements are optiona.  <b></b> / <b>
