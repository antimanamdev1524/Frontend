<!-- What are emojis?
Emojis look like images or icons but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode)
character set.

UTF-8 characters
many UTF-8 characters can not be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

<meta charset="UTF-8"> -->


    <!-- To display an HTML page correctly, the browser must know what character set (encoding) to use:
