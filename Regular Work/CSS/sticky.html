<!--

The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky

Elements are then positioned using the 

top, 
bottom, 
left,
right properties. 

However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
